# Karakeep Auto Adder

I was annoyed by adding links to [Karakeep]("https://karakeep.app) so I wanted to have a Telegram Bot where I can send my links to which then are automatically added to Karakeep.
This is the result.

Copy the [.env.template](.env.template) file to `.env` and configure the server before starting.
